# Postponed Issues

Issues the owner has deliberately postponed until **after the project's phases are finished**.
Each was found during a phase's work, judged not blocking, and parked here rather than fixed in the
task that found it. None is a financial-correctness defect that can be accepted silently; anything of
that kind belongs in the owning phase's gate, not here.

This file is the work list for the post-phase clean-up. When an issue is fixed, mark it `FIXED` with the
commit and the date; do not delete the entry.

## PI-001 — Lending's loan account opener has no up-front judgement of existing accounts

- **Status:** `POSTPONED` (owner, 2026-10-17: "create a postponed issues md file and we will fix them after
  project phases finished").
- **Found by:** P12-TSK-003's completion gate, comparing `BnplAccounts` with its lending precedent.
- **Where:** `lending/src/main/java/com/finapp/lending/LoanAccounts.java` — `openFor(Connection, LoanId,
  CurrencyCode)` (~line 104).
- **What:** `LoanAccounts.openFor` converges the loan's six ledger accounts one by one through
  `createOrConverge` and judges each account only after converging it. It never reads the loan's existing
  accounts first. `BnplAccounts.openFor` (`bnpl/src/main/java/com/finapp/bnpl/BnplAccounts.java` ~line 107)
  reads the owner's existing accounts once (`LedgerAccountStore#findAllOwned`, no lock) and refuses before
  its first insert if any is mis-shaped, then judges each converged account again.
- **Consequence today:** a wrong-typed account is met only after earlier inserts in the same transaction (the
  whole transaction still rolls back — nothing is half-written); an account of the loan in another currency,
  or under a purpose outside the six, is never noticed by the opener, because the convergence key includes
  both the purpose and the currency. No production path creates such an account today, so this is a
  defensive gap, not a live defect.
- **Fix:** give `LoanAccounts.openFor` the same lock-free pre-read and refusal as `BnplAccounts.openFor`
  (keep the post-convergence judgement); add the matching hermetic cases to `LoanAccountsTest` and a
  database case to `LoanChartDatabaseTest`; probe it (pre-read disabled → the new case red).
- **Owner of the fix:** the post-phase clean-up.
