## Current Phase

**Phase 0 — Domain and Architecture Foundation**
Status: `IN_PROGRESS`

Entry gate passed on 2026-08-31. All twelve entry-gate criteria in
[`PHASE_GATES.md`](PHASE_GATES.md) §2 are satisfied: the delivery plan is written, bounded
contexts and module boundaries are defined, the invariant catalog exists, the backlog is
elaborated to task granularity, and ADR-0001 through ADR-0012 are recorded as `Proposed`.

Phase 0 delivers a buildable, boundary-enforced modular monolith containing the financial and
platform kernel, with **zero business capability**. That constraint is deliberate: money
representation, idempotency, outbox, audit and correlation cannot be retrofitted once
financial history exists.

## Current Milestone

**M0.1 — Buildable, boundary-enforced skeleton**
`P0-EPIC-01` (Build and Repository Foundation) and `P0-EPIC-02` (Module Architecture and
Boundary Enforcement).

Milestone complete when: a Gradle multi-module Spring Boot build is green in CI from a clean
clone; `platform`, `sharedkernel` and `app` modules exist with enforced dependency direction;
ArchUnit boundary rules fail the build on a deliberately introduced violation; PostgreSQL,
Kafka and Redis run locally with pinned versions matching the test infrastructure.

Subsequent Phase 0 milestones:
- **M0.2** Financial kernel — `P0-EPIC-03`, `P0-EPIC-04`
- **M0.3** Correctness primitives — `P0-EPIC-05`, `P0-EPIC-06`, `P0-EPIC-07`
- **M0.4** API, observability, security baseline — `P0-EPIC-08`, `-09`, `-10`
- **M0.5** Test infrastructure and phase review — `P0-EPIC-11`, `P0-EPIC-12`

## Current Task

**`P0-TSK-007` — ArchUnit boundary rules**
Status: `READY` — not started.

Bounded context: platform. Depends on `P0-TSK-002` (`COMPLETE`) and `P0-TSK-006`
(`COMPLETE`).

Scope: rules forbidding cross-module internal access, cross-module entity references,
reverse dependencies and framework leakage into `sharedkernel`.

Acceptance: rules pass on the current codebase; each rule is proven by a deliberately
introduced violation that fails the build, then reverted.

Full definition: [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) §P0-EPIC-02. DoD profile: `DOD-TEST`.

### Just completed

**`P0-TSK-006` — Define the context-to-module map** — `COMPLETE` (2026-08-31).

[`MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../architecture/MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md) now carries a
context-to-module map, a register recording all nine boundary attributes for every module,
and an authoritative-state ownership table.

| Acceptance criterion | Evidence |
|---|---|
| All boundary attributes for every planned module | 24 modules × 9 attributes, verified mechanically — each of responsibility, owns, transaction, consistency, APIs, events, failure, security, operations appears exactly 24 times |
| No state has two owners | Verified by script over every §4 `Owns:` line: 0 states named by two modules. This check found and resolved an `Instalment` conflict during review |
| Every bounded context mapped | All 28 contexts map to a module, verified by script: 0 unmapped |

Three things the mapping exercise found, which is the point of doing it rather than
assuming it:
- **Two bounded contexts were missing** from `BOUNDED_CONTEXTS.md` — `Transfers` and
  `Case Management` — while modules were already planned for both. Added; the list now
  holds 28.
- **"Case" was at risk of two owners.** The delivery plan describes case management as
  "shared across KYC, fraud and AML", and `kyc` separately owns a Review Task. Resolved as
  two distinct states rather than one shared one; a genuinely shared store would have to be
  its own module with a single owner.
- **The acceptance criterion miscounted.** It asked for "eight" attributes; `CLAUDE.md`
  lists nine. `CLAUDE.md` is the authority, so the map records nine and the backlog is
  corrected.

Decisions recorded in [ADR-0012](../adr/ADR-0012-context-to-module-mapping.md): 28 contexts
map to 24 modules; a context is never split across modules; every merge records the evidence
that would trigger a split, because starting merged is the reversible direction.

## Completed Capabilities

**Business capabilities: none** — by design (Phase 0 §2 of the delivery plan).

Platform foundation (2026-08-31), `P0-TSK-001`:
- Gradle 9.7.1 wrapper; distribution **and** wrapper jar verified by SHA-256 against
  `services.gradle.org`
- Version catalog as the single source of dependency versions
- Java 21 toolchain pinned via a `build-logic` convention plugin, with the foojay resolver
  provisioning a JDK where the machine lacks one
- Spring Boot 4.1.1 BOM; the Boot plugin applied only to the executable module, so library
  modules can take version alignment without `bootJar` packaging
- Placeholder `app` module carrying no business capability
- Reproducible archives; `-Werror`; LF enforced on `gradlew` so Linux CI is not broken by a
  Windows checkout

Module skeleton (2026-08-31), `P0-TSK-002`:
- `sharedkernel`, `platform` and `app` with the direction `app -> platform -> sharedkernel`,
  enforced structurally by Gradle and asserted by classpath tests
- `sharedkernel` is framework-free and provably carries no Spring artefact
- `java-library` everywhere, making `api`/`implementation` a deliberate boundary control
- No production code in either new module beyond boundary documentation

Local infrastructure (2026-08-31), `P0-TSK-003`:
- `compose.yaml` with PostgreSQL 18.6, Kafka 4.3.1 (KRaft) and Redis 8.10.1, pinned,
  health-checked, on named volumes, bound to loopback only
- Image versions single-sourced in the version catalog, with a build task that fails on
  drift between `compose.yaml` and the catalog

Migration tooling (2026-08-31), `P0-TSK-005`:
- Flyway 12.4.0, pinned to the Spring Boot BOM version, applied to the `platform` module
- Forward-only migrations with module-owned schema history (ADR-0011)
- `V001` creates the `platform` schema, documents its ownership, and revokes `PUBLIC`
- Migration conventions documented, including irreversible financial migrations and the
  privilege model the DB-level invariants require

Continuous integration (2026-08-31), `P0-TSK-004`:
- Four gates on every change: build/tests/boundary checks, migrations against a real
  PostgreSQL, secret scan over full git history, dependency scan of a CycloneDX SBOM
- Every third-party action pinned to a commit SHA; both scanners pinned to image digests
- The Java version CI installs is read from the version catalog rather than duplicated
- The `migrations` job starts PostgreSQL from the project's own `compose.yaml`, so CI and a
  developer run the identical pinned image

Architecture baseline (2026-08-31), `P0-TSK-006`:
- Context-to-module map: all 28 bounded contexts mapped to 24 modules, merges justified with
  recorded split triggers (ADR-0012)
- Single ownership verified by script over the register, not by reading it
- Module register with all nine `CLAUDE.md` boundary attributes for every module
- Authoritative-state ownership table proving no state has two owners

Project initiation (2026-08-31):
- Master delivery plan for all seventeen phases — [`DELIVERY_PLAN.md`](DELIVERY_PLAN.md)
- Phase gate model, status model and per-phase exit criteria — [`PHASE_GATES.md`](PHASE_GATES.md)
- Engineering backlog with Phase 0 elaborated to task granularity — [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md)
- First architecture baseline — [`MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../architecture/MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Invariant catalog, 64 invariants — [`FINANCIAL_INVARIANTS.md`](../domain/FINANCIAL_INVARIANTS.md)
- Definition of Done with task-type profiles — [`DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`](DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md)
- Execution protocol — [`EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`](EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md)
- ADR-0001 through ADR-0010 (`Proposed`) — [`docs/adr/`](../adr/README.md)
- Roadmap with sequencing rationale and seam register — [`ROADMAP.md`](../product/ROADMAP.md)

## Active Work

None in progress. `P0-TSK-007` is the next task.

## Blockers

None.

`P0-TSK-004` (CI pipeline) was recorded as blocked. The 2026-08-31 task completion review
found the blocker was a defect in the backlog, not in the work: `P0-TSK-004` declared
dependencies on `P0-TSK-011` (Money persistence mapping) and `P0-TSK-036` (test taxonomy),
neither of which is required to run a build with its tests. Because both are scheduled after
several tasks carrying `DOD-BUILD`, whose "CI green" criterion they could therefore never
satisfy, the plan contained an unsatisfiable requirement. Dependencies corrected to
`P0-TSK-001, P0-TSK-002`; CI is now startable and closes the outstanding `DOD-BUILD` gap
across all four completed tasks.

---

## Local Environment Prerequisites

Machine-specific setup that the repository deliberately does **not** contain. The build must
work on any machine without local edits (`DOD-BUILD`: "no developer-machine-specific
assumptions"), so anything below belongs in `GRADLE_USER_HOME`, never in the repo.

**TLS interception by antivirus (this development machine).** AVG "Web/Mail Shield"
intercepts HTTPS and re-signs it with its own root CA. Windows trusts that CA; the JDK's
bundled `cacerts` does not. Java tooling therefore fails with:

```
PKIX path building failed ... unable to find valid certification path to requested target
```

while `curl` and the browser work — which makes it look like a Gradle fault rather than a
TLS-trust one. Resolved in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` (outside the repo):

```properties
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=Windows-ROOT -Xmx2g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m
```

That covers the Gradle daemon. Bootstrapping the distribution runs in a separate JVM that
reads `GRADLE_OPTS`, so on a machine with no Gradle distribution cached also export:

```
GRADLE_OPTS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=Windows-ROOT"
```

Alternatives: import the AVG root into the JDK `cacerts` with `keytool`, or disable HTTPS
scanning in AVG.

**Resolved for CI (`P0-TSK-004`):** this is specific to this machine. GitHub-hosted runners
perform no TLS interception, so the workflow needs no equivalent setting. If CI ever moves
to a self-hosted runner behind an intercepting proxy, that runner needs the same treatment —
in its own environment, never in the repository.

**Git Bash rewrites container paths.** Running a command inside a container with an absolute
path from Git Bash (MSYS) silently rewrites it:

```
docker compose exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh ...
  -> exec: "C:/Program Files/Git/opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh": no such file
```

Prefix with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`, or use PowerShell. This affects interactive use only —
health checks and container entrypoints run inside Docker and are unaffected.

**`clean` fails with "Unable to delete directory".** On Windows an orphaned Gradle daemon
keeps module jars open, so `clean` cannot remove `build/`. It is leftover state, not a repo
defect. `./gradlew --stop` handles the usual case; a daemon whose `GRADLE_USER_HOME` has been
deleted survives that and must be killed by PID:

```
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='java.exe'" |
  Where-Object { $_.CommandLine -match 'GradleDaemon' } |
  ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_.ProcessId -Force }
```

**Resetting local infrastructure.** `docker compose down` keeps data; `docker compose down -v`
discards it. A reset is required after changing Kafka's `CLUSTER_ID`, or when moving to a new
PostgreSQL major version without running `pg_upgrade` — the volume is formatted for the major
version that created it.

## Partially Satisfied Definition of Done

Recorded so it is not mistaken for a completed criterion.

| Task | DoD item not yet met | Owning task |
|------|---------------------|-------------|
| `P0-TSK-001` — `P0-TSK-005` | `DOD-BUILD` requires "CI green". A pipeline now exists and all four jobs pass when run locally, but it has never executed on a CI runner because the repository has no git remote. This closes on the first successful run after a remote is added. | Adding a remote |
| `P0-TSK-004` | The CycloneDX SBOM covers the whole resolved dependency set, test scope included (21 of ~61 components). Plugin 3.4.1 exposes no configuration filter. Adequate for vulnerability scanning — test libraries execute on CI runners, so they are legitimately in scope — but it means a HIGH/CRITICAL advisory in a test-only library fails the build though nothing vulnerable ships, and **the SBOM must not be published as shipping provenance in this form** because it overstates what is deployed. | Phase 15 (supply chain and provenance) |
| `P0-TSK-004` | CI actions and scanner images are pinned by SHA/digest with no automated update path, so the pins will rot. | `P0-TSK-040` |
| `P0-TSK-002` | Boundary enforcement is partial: Gradle enforces dependency direction and classpath tests assert module isolation, but cross-module internals and entity references rest on review until ArchUnit lands. | `P0-TSK-007` |
| `P0-TSK-003`, `P0-TSK-005` | Local PostgreSQL runs as the cluster superuser, so the database-privilege invariants (`INV-LED-03`, `INV-HIST-01`, `INV-HIST-03`) cannot yet be exercised. The migrator/application role split is designed and documented (`DATA_MIGRATIONS.md` §5) but not implemented, and must land **before** any table subject to those invariants is created. | `P0-TSK-022` |

---

## Known Architectural Debt

None yet. Debt is recorded here as it is deliberately accepted, with: what was deferred, why,
what risk it carries, what triggers paying it down, and the owning phase.

Per [`EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`](EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md) §Architectural Debt,
**financial-correctness debt is never accepted** — an invariant is either protected or the
work is not done.

Note: items in [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) §Deliberately Deferred are scoping decisions,
not debt.

## Unresolved Architectural Questions

Ordered by when they must be answered. Each requires an ADR before the work that depends on
it begins.

| # | Question | Must resolve by | Risk if unresolved |
|---|----------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 1 | Isolation level and locking strategy for concurrent postings | Phase 3 | **High** — lost updates or double spend under contention (`INV-CON-01`) |
| 2 | Chart-of-accounts structure and its relationship to the Phase 14 GL | Phase 3 | High — a narrow structure forces retroactive remapping, breaking `INV-ACC-04` |
| 3 | Balance projection placement (ledger schema vs separate read store) | Phase 3 | Medium — affects contention and rebuild cost (ADR-0009) |
| 4 | Whether `accounts` and `wallet` are one module or two | Phase 3 | Medium — **working position recorded** (one module, `MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md` §3 M1) with a named split trigger; still to be confirmed |
| 5 | Transfer/ledger transaction boundary and compensation strategy | Phase 4 | High — determines whether a saga is ever needed internally |
| 6 | Accounting treatment of authorization (memo/hold) vs capture (posting) | Phase 5 | High — misstates available funds if wrong |
| 7 | Whether `checkout` is its own module or part of `merchant` | Phase 6 | Low — **working position recorded** (own module, §3 M2) with a named merge trigger |
| 8 | Fee model: who pays, when recognised, gross vs net settlement | Phase 6 | High — changing revenue recognition after postings exist is a restatement |
| 9 | Which payment rail to simulate first, and its finality semantics | Phase 5 | Medium — first rail shapes the abstraction (mitigated by designing to `PAYMENT_LIFECYCLES.md`) |
| 10 | Which jurisdiction-neutral compliance abstractions belong in the MVP | Phase 2 | Medium |
| 11 | Fail-safe policy for risk evaluation: block or allow on unavailability | Phase 13 | High — a wrong default is either an outage or an open door |

Resolved during initiation:
- ~~Which modules form the initial modular-monolith cut?~~ → [`MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../architecture/MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- ~~Deployment topology?~~ → ADR-0001
- ~~Money representation?~~ → ADR-0003
- ~~Idempotency mechanism?~~ → ADR-0004
- ~~Reliable event publication?~~ → ADR-0005
- ~~Is balance authoritative or derived?~~ → ADR-0009

## Next Task

**`P0-TSK-007` — ArchUnit boundary rules.**

Rationale: `P0-TSK-006` produced a design contract; nothing enforces it. Gradle enforces
dependency *direction* only — nothing currently prevents a module reaching into another's
internals, referencing another's entities, or quietly acquiring a second owner for a piece
of state. `P0-TSK-007` is what converts `MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md` §6 from reviewed into
enforced, and it is now unblocked.

Per [`EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`](EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md) rule 4, work stays within that task —
boundary rules only. The no-floating-point-money rule is `P0-TSK-008` and additionally
depends on `Money` existing (`P0-TSK-009`).

## Change Log

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-08-31 | Task completion review of `P0-TSK-006`. Four defects found and fixed, all by mechanical checks rather than re-reading: `Instalment` owned by both `lending` and `bnpl` (the headline acceptance criterion, violated); the `app` module absent from the register entirely; `paymentmethods` and `crossborder` missing from the layering diagram; the §5 ownership table maintained as a second enumeration that could drift from §4. |
| 2026-08-31 | `P0-TSK-006` complete. Context-to-module map: 28 contexts to 24 modules, all nine boundary attributes per module, authoritative-state ownership table. Found two missing bounded contexts and one state at risk of two owners. ADR-0012 records the mapping decision. |
| 2026-08-31 | `P0-TSK-004` complete. CI with four gates: build/tests, migrations against real PostgreSQL, secret scan over full history, SBOM dependency scan. Actions SHA-pinned, scanners digest-pinned. Not yet executed on a runner — no git remote exists. |
| 2026-08-31 | Task completion review of `P0-TSK-001`, `-002`, `-003`, `-005`. No critical or financial findings — no money-handling code exists yet. Six important findings fixed: an unsatisfiable `DOD-BUILD` "CI green" requirement caused by over-specified `P0-TSK-004` dependencies; a one-directional infrastructure drift check that let an unpinned image pass (proven, then closed); dead Spring Boot configuration in `build-logic` (proven unnecessary); an unnecessary Spring test stack in `platform` contradicting its own comment; a name-substring scope test replaced with a structural one; ADR-0011 missing from `DECISIONS.md`. Java toolchain version moved into the version catalog, removing four duplicated copies of "21". |
| 2026-08-31 | `P0-TSK-005` complete. Flyway 12.4.0, forward-only, module-owned schema history; ADR-0011 and `DATA_MIGRATIONS.md` written. |
| 2026-08-31 | `P0-TSK-003` complete. Local infrastructure (PostgreSQL 18.6, Kafka 4.3.1 KRaft, Redis 8.10.1), pinned and health-checked, with a build-enforced version-drift check against the catalog. |
| 2026-08-31 | `P0-TSK-002` complete. `sharedkernel`, `platform`, `app` with enforced dependency direction; `sharedkernel` proven Spring-free; `java-library` adopted for `api`/`implementation` boundary control. |
| 2026-08-31 | `P0-TSK-001` complete. Gradle 9.7.1 multi-module build, Java 21 toolchain, Spring Boot 4.1.1 BOM, `build-logic` conventions, checksum-pinned wrapper. Phase 0 `IN_PROGRESS`. Repository placed under Git. |
| 2026-08-31 | Project initiation. Delivery plan, phase gates, backlog, architecture baseline, invariant catalog, Definition of Done, execution protocol and ADR-0001..0010 created. Phase 0 entry gate passed; status `READY`. |
