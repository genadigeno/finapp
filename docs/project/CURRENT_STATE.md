## Current Phase

**Phase 0 — Domain and Architecture Foundation**
Status: `IN_PROGRESS`

Entry gate passed on 2026-08-31. All twelve entry-gate criteria in
[`PHASE_GATES.md`](PHASE_GATES.md) §2 are satisfied: the delivery plan is written, bounded
contexts and module boundaries are defined, the invariant catalog exists, the backlog is
elaborated to task granularity, and ADR-0001 through ADR-0010 are recorded as `Proposed`.

Phase 0 delivers a buildable, boundary-enforced modular monolith containing the financial and
platform kernel, with **zero business capability**. That constraint is deliberate: money
representation, idempotency, outbox, audit and correlation cannot be retrofitted once
financial history exists.

## Current Milestone

**M0.1 — Buildable, boundary-enforced skeleton**
`P0-EPIC-01` (Build and Repository Foundation) and `P0-EPIC-02` (Module Architecture and
Boundary Enforcement).

Milestone complete when: a Gradle multi-module Spring Boot build is green in CI from a clean
clone; `platform`, `sharedkernel` and `app` modules exist with enforced dependency direction;
ArchUnit boundary rules fail the build on a deliberately introduced violation; PostgreSQL,
Kafka and Redis run locally with pinned versions matching the test infrastructure.

Subsequent Phase 0 milestones:
- **M0.2** Financial kernel — `P0-EPIC-03`, `P0-EPIC-04`
- **M0.3** Correctness primitives — `P0-EPIC-05`, `P0-EPIC-06`, `P0-EPIC-07`
- **M0.4** API, observability, security baseline — `P0-EPIC-08`, `-09`, `-10`
- **M0.5** Test infrastructure and phase review — `P0-EPIC-11`, `P0-EPIC-12`

## Current Task

**`P0-TSK-004` — CI pipeline**
Status: `BLOCKED` — dependencies not met.

Bounded context: platform / build. Depends on `P0-TSK-001` (`COMPLETE`), `P0-TSK-011`
(Money persistence mapping, not started) and `P0-TSK-036` (test taxonomy, not started).

Because `P0-TSK-004` is blocked, the next startable task is **`P0-TSK-005` — Database
migration tooling** (depends on `P0-TSK-003`, now `COMPLETE`).

### Just completed

**`P0-TSK-003` — Local infrastructure via Docker Compose** — `COMPLETE` (2026-08-31).

| Acceptance criterion | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `docker compose up` yields all three healthy | PostgreSQL 18.6, Kafka 4.3.1, Redis 8.10.1 all reported `healthy`; verified again after a full `down`/`up` cycle |
| Versions match those used by Testcontainers | Versions live in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`; `verifyInfrastructureVersions` runs under `check` and fails on drift (demonstrated). `P0-TSK-035` consumes the same catalog entries |
| No credentials committed beyond marked local-only defaults | Throwaway values named `local-development-only-not-a-secret`, each overridable by environment variable |

Beyond the stated criteria, verified functionally rather than by health check alone:
PostgreSQL accepts queries and uses the ICU collation provider (`datlocprovider = i`,
`datlocale = und-x-icu`); Kafka creates, describes and deletes a topic; Redis round-trips a
value. Data survived a full stack restart, confirming the named volumes. All three ports
bind to `127.0.0.1` only, confirmed with `netstat` — a development database listening on
`0.0.0.0` is a real exposure on a laptop that joins untrusted networks.

## Completed Capabilities

**Business capabilities: none** — by design (Phase 0 §2 of the delivery plan).

Platform foundation (2026-08-31), `P0-TSK-001`:
- Gradle 9.7.1 wrapper; distribution **and** wrapper jar verified by SHA-256 against
  `services.gradle.org`
- Version catalog as the single source of dependency versions
- Java 21 toolchain pinned via a `build-logic` convention plugin, with the foojay resolver
  provisioning a JDK where the machine lacks one
- Spring Boot 4.1.1 BOM; the Boot plugin applied only to the executable module, so library
  modules can take version alignment without `bootJar` packaging
- Placeholder `app` module carrying no business capability
- Reproducible archives; `-Werror`; LF enforced on `gradlew` so Linux CI is not broken by a
  Windows checkout

Module skeleton (2026-08-31), `P0-TSK-002`:
- `sharedkernel`, `platform` and `app` with the direction `app -> platform -> sharedkernel`,
  enforced structurally by Gradle and asserted by classpath tests
- `sharedkernel` is framework-free and provably carries no Spring artefact
- `java-library` everywhere, making `api`/`implementation` a deliberate boundary control
- No production code in either new module beyond boundary documentation

Local infrastructure (2026-08-31), `P0-TSK-003`:
- `compose.yaml` with PostgreSQL 18.6, Kafka 4.3.1 (KRaft) and Redis 8.10.1, pinned,
  health-checked, on named volumes, bound to loopback only
- Image versions single-sourced in the version catalog, with a build task that fails on
  drift between `compose.yaml` and the catalog

Project initiation (2026-08-31):
- Master delivery plan for all seventeen phases — [`DELIVERY_PLAN.md`](DELIVERY_PLAN.md)
- Phase gate model, status model and per-phase exit criteria — [`PHASE_GATES.md`](PHASE_GATES.md)
- Engineering backlog with Phase 0 elaborated to task granularity — [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md)
- First architecture baseline — [`MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../architecture/MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Invariant catalog, 64 invariants — [`FINANCIAL_INVARIANTS.md`](../domain/FINANCIAL_INVARIANTS.md)
- Definition of Done with task-type profiles — [`DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`](DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md)
- Execution protocol — [`EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`](EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md)
- ADR-0001 through ADR-0010 (`Proposed`) — [`docs/adr/`](../adr/README.md)
- Roadmap with sequencing rationale and seam register — [`ROADMAP.md`](../product/ROADMAP.md)

## Active Work

None in progress. `P0-TSK-005` is the next startable task; `P0-TSK-004` is blocked.

## Blockers

**`P0-TSK-004` (CI pipeline)** cannot start yet. It depends on `P0-TSK-011` and
`P0-TSK-036`, neither of which has started, and it must also resolve the TLS-interception
problem below for whatever runner it uses. This is sequencing, not an impediment — but it
means `DOD-BUILD`'s "CI green" stays unmet across every task completed so far.

---

## Local Environment Prerequisites

Machine-specific setup that the repository deliberately does **not** contain. The build must
work on any machine without local edits (`DOD-BUILD`: "no developer-machine-specific
assumptions"), so anything below belongs in `GRADLE_USER_HOME`, never in the repo.

**TLS interception by antivirus (this development machine).** AVG "Web/Mail Shield"
intercepts HTTPS and re-signs it with its own root CA. Windows trusts that CA; the JDK's
bundled `cacerts` does not. Java tooling therefore fails with:

```
PKIX path building failed ... unable to find valid certification path to requested target
```

while `curl` and the browser work — which makes it look like a Gradle fault rather than a
TLS-trust one. Resolved in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` (outside the repo):

```properties
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=Windows-ROOT -Xmx2g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m
```

That covers the Gradle daemon. Bootstrapping the distribution runs in a separate JVM that
reads `GRADLE_OPTS`, so on a machine with no Gradle distribution cached also export:

```
GRADLE_OPTS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=Windows-ROOT"
```

Alternatives: import the AVG root into the JDK `cacerts` with `keytool`, or disable HTTPS
scanning in AVG. This must be revisited at `P0-TSK-004` — CI runners will need whatever the
equivalent is in that environment.

**Git Bash rewrites container paths.** Running a command inside a container with an absolute
path from Git Bash (MSYS) silently rewrites it:

```
docker compose exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh ...
  -> exec: "C:/Program Files/Git/opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh": no such file
```

Prefix with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`, or use PowerShell. This affects interactive use only —
health checks and container entrypoints run inside Docker and are unaffected.

**Resetting local infrastructure.** `docker compose down` keeps data; `docker compose down -v`
discards it. A reset is required after changing Kafka's `CLUSTER_ID`, or when moving to a new
PostgreSQL major version without running `pg_upgrade` — the volume is formatted for the major
version that created it.

## Partially Satisfied Definition of Done

Recorded so it is not mistaken for a completed criterion.

| Task | DoD item not yet met | Owning task |
|------|---------------------|-------------|
| `P0-TSK-001` | `DOD-BUILD` requires "CI green". No CI pipeline exists yet, so the build is verified only locally — including from a clean clone with an empty Gradle home. | `P0-TSK-004` |
| `P0-TSK-002` | Same: no CI. Boundary enforcement is also partial — Gradle enforces direction, but cross-module internals and entity references rest on review. | `P0-TSK-004`, `P0-TSK-007` |
| `P0-TSK-003` | Same: no CI. Additionally, local PostgreSQL runs as the cluster superuser, so the database-privilege invariants (`INV-LED-03`, `INV-HIST-01`, `INV-HIST-03`) cannot yet be exercised locally — they need a restricted application role. | `P0-TSK-004`, `P0-TSK-005`, `P0-TSK-022` |

---

## Known Architectural Debt

None yet. Debt is recorded here as it is deliberately accepted, with: what was deferred, why,
what risk it carries, what triggers paying it down, and the owning phase.

Per [`EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`](EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md) §Architectural Debt,
**financial-correctness debt is never accepted** — an invariant is either protected or the
work is not done.

Note: items in [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) §Deliberately Deferred are scoping decisions,
not debt.

---

## Unresolved Architectural Questions

Ordered by when they must be answered. Each requires an ADR before the work that depends on
it begins.

| # | Question | Must resolve by | Risk if unresolved |
|---|----------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 1 | Isolation level and locking strategy for concurrent postings | Phase 3 | **High** — lost updates or double spend under contention (`INV-CON-01`) |
| 2 | Chart-of-accounts structure and its relationship to the Phase 14 GL | Phase 3 | High — a narrow structure forces retroactive remapping, breaking `INV-ACC-04` |
| 3 | Balance projection placement (ledger schema vs separate read store) | Phase 3 | Medium — affects contention and rebuild cost (ADR-0009) |
| 4 | Whether `accounts` and `wallet` are one module or two | Phase 3 | Medium — splitting later is cheap; merging authoritative state later is not |
| 5 | Transfer/ledger transaction boundary and compensation strategy | Phase 4 | High — determines whether a saga is ever needed internally |
| 6 | Accounting treatment of authorization (memo/hold) vs capture (posting) | Phase 5 | High — misstates available funds if wrong |
| 7 | Whether `checkout` is its own module or part of `merchant` | Phase 6 | Low |
| 8 | Fee model: who pays, when recognised, gross vs net settlement | Phase 6 | High — changing revenue recognition after postings exist is a restatement |
| 9 | Which payment rail to simulate first, and its finality semantics | Phase 5 | Medium — first rail shapes the abstraction (mitigated by designing to `PAYMENT_LIFECYCLES.md`) |
| 10 | Which jurisdiction-neutral compliance abstractions belong in the MVP | Phase 2 | Medium |
| 11 | Fail-safe policy for risk evaluation: block or allow on unavailability | Phase 13 | High — a wrong default is either an outage or an open door |

Resolved during initiation:
- ~~Which modules form the initial modular-monolith cut?~~ → [`MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../architecture/MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- ~~Deployment topology?~~ → ADR-0001
- ~~Money representation?~~ → ADR-0003
- ~~Idempotency mechanism?~~ → ADR-0004
- ~~Reliable event publication?~~ → ADR-0005
- ~~Is balance authoritative or derived?~~ → ADR-0009

## Next Task

**`P0-TSK-005` — Database migration tooling.**

Rationale: `P0-TSK-004` (CI) is blocked on `P0-TSK-011` and `P0-TSK-036`. `P0-TSK-005` is
now unblocked by `P0-TSK-003` and is on the critical path to everything with a schema — the
idempotency table, outbox, inbox and audit trail all need migrations before they can exist,
and every one of those is a Phase 0 exit-gate item.

The migration *convention* matters more than the tool. Once financial history exists,
migrations against immutable tables are constrained by `INV-HIST-01` and `INV-LED-03`, so
forward-only migrations and a documented approach to irreversible financial changes must be
settled before the first table is created.

Per [`EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`](EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md) rule 4, work stays within that task —
migration tooling and conventions only. No business tables, no idempotency table
(`P0-TSK-015`), no outbox (`P0-TSK-019`), no audit schema (`P0-TSK-022`).
